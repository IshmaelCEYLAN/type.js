This javascript library allows us define interfaces, types and traits. A defined type can be inherited
by other types, traits can also be used by types and types can implements multiple interfaces.

Interfaces can be considered as abstract types. Arguments of methods, their types, whether they are required or not, and the type of return value can be declared with Interfaces. The only thing you can't do is define the body of a method. Interfaces can draw outlines of methods and properties. So when a type implements one (or more) interfaces, that type have to follow the rules defined in those interfaces. If incompatibility detected an error is thrown and execution stops.

It is immediately checked whether required arguments are defined and if not, error will appear before the relevant method has ever run. However, the relevant method is constantly monitored during runtime to see whether it is called legally. It does this by placing a proxy method instead of the main method you wrote. This may affect performance, but since Type.js is completely native JavaScript, you can enclose the entire interface architecture in if-else blocks. If there is an ENV variable in your work environment that holds values such as development and production, types decide to implement interfaces or not, depending on that env value. Thus, while you use the interface in the development environment, you can ensure that it is not used in the production environment. You can even ensure that the interface codes do not contamine the compiled codes if your bundler shake trees.

Type.js uses chained __proto__ mechanism. So this means that all inherited type methods, properties and trait methods etc. will collected according proto area and those proto objects will chained. Type.js creates almost the same object as you would get when you use the class and extends structure, which is the syntactic sugar in Modern JavaScript.

The use of __proto__ is no longer recommended and may not be supported in some environments, so type.js is designed to work in legacy environments and you should use type.js when writing code for legacy environments. It is not recommended to use type.js in modern environments.

## Usage
### Let's create a trait specific to living things
```javascript
var Breathable = Trait( "Breathable" ).prototype(
{
    breath: function()
    {
        console.log( "Yay! I can breath." );
    }
});
```
Trait methods are added to the prototype area of the types that use it. Therefore, the instance scope
(this word) refers to the type to which they belong, not trait object. However, all properties defined on types and traits are added to the instance produced from the final type after passing through a property inheritance algorithm. This algorithm produces the result with the class mechanism that comes with EcmaScript 6.

### Implementing Types
```javascript
var Creature = Type( "Creature" ).use( Breathable ).prototype(
{
    construct: function()
    {
        console.log( "Yay! I'm alive." );
    }
    
    live: function()
    {
        console.log( "Since I'm alive, why can't I live?" );
    }
});
```
The `construct` method performs the constructive operations of the type. Each time
created an instance from a type, the method runs once, taking the given parameters. In this
method, we can perform the initializations works, create initial values for properties of the type.

### Let's create intermediate type
```javascript
var Animal = Type( "Animal" ).extends( Creature ).prototype(
{
    construct: function()
    {
        // first, let the creature's constructor work
        this.super( "construct" );
        
        // now, the actions concerning the Animal type can work
        console.log( "I'm not a veggy, there is an animal inside of me" );
    }
});
```
### Let's create some humanly traits
```javascript
var Speakable = Trait( "Speakable" ).prototype(
{
    speak: function( words )
    {
        console.log( "I'm talking!", words );
    }
});
```

The trait can also define `construct` method. This method will also works on
the instance of the Type that uses the trait. It provides a useful space for
performing primitive actions related to trait. So it is not necessary to create
pollution within the constructor of the Type. If the type also has to define it's own
`construct` method this mathod override trait's method but we can access and run it with 
super method.

### Let's create a new and powerful type
```javascript
var Human = Type( "Human" ).extends( Animal ).use( Speakable ).prototype(
{
    AS:
    {
        // we can rename the method "speak" taken from
        // the trait named "Speakable" as "talk"
        speak: "talk"
    },
    
    construct: function( name )
    {
        // first, let's run animal's constructor
        this.super( "construct" );

        // now, we can initialize the Human
        console.log( "And my name is " + name );
        
        // it should breath immediately otherwise it may die just now
        this.breath();
        // it should speak just now or it may still die
        this.talk( "Those are my first words." );
    }
    
    live: function()
    {
        // this method has been inherited from the "creature" type up to this point, but
        // we have defined the "live" method here again, so we rejected the inheritance, but
        // I want to add something on developing this heritage, not to refuse it.
        this.super( "live" );
        
        // now we can improve our heritage.
        console.log( "I live like a human!" );
    }
});
```

The `super` method provides access to the inherited type.

##### Calling a particular method of the parent
super(String, [...Array])

##### Calling the construct method of the parent
super(...Params)

##### Accessing the parent context
super()

### Let's create instances from types
```javascript
var ismail = Human.new( "Ä°smail" );

    ismail.live();
    ismail.talk( "Hello world!" );
```

### Testing "Is A" relations
```javascript
// please remember that the "ismail" object does not directly extends
// the "Creature" type. It extends the "Animal" intermediate type.
ismail.is( Creature );
// true

ismail.is( Animal );
// true

Human.is( Creature );
// true

ismail.behave( Breathable );
// true
```

### Creating singleton object from types
```javascript
// ## app.js
var somebody = Human.singleton( "mykey", [ "Donald" ]);
    somebody.lastName = "Trump";

// ## same runtime
// ## islem.js
Human.singleton( "mykey" ).lastName;
// -- or --
Human.instance.mykey.lastName;
// Trump
```
### Accessing type related meta datas from instances
```javascript
var janedoe = Human.new( "Jane Doe" );

    janedoe.type.name;
    // Human
    
    janedoe.type.behaviours;
    // [ "Breathable", "Speakable" ]
    
    janedoe.type.types;
    // [ "Human", "Animal", "Creature" ]
```
